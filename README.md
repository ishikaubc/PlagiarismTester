Project Description:

Formulate an algorithm into a problem by defining the problem and identifying the input and output of the problem. 
Implement hash based functions to calculate unique value of each piece of text 
Compare the hash values of the text to check for plagiarism against the database of the original text.
Use String Matching Algorithms such as Rabin Karp algorithm and KMP to search for a match between the text to be searched and the original text.
Use machine learning techniques to improve the performance of the detector
Test and evaluate the system using a dataset of original and plagiarized text
